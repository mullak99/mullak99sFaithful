~~ Vattic's Usage Guidelines ~~

It is fine for people to use stuff from the Faithful 32x32 pack so long as you follow the guidelines bellow.

You must:
- Give clear credit.
- Link back to the Faithful 32x32 thread.
- Be honest about what you are using.

Remix packs are not allowed unless:
- You are a Let's Player sharing a modified copy with fans.
- You are an adventure map maker using a modified copy to go along with it.

Things that are fine:
- Use as placeholders.
- Using as many textures as you've made yourself.
- Using the items or paintings.
- Use as base for mod textures.
