== Noteworthy Mentions and Credits ==

Vattic - Faithful 32x (Original textures)
xMrVizzy/Faithful Team - Faithful Team (Some Pre-JAPPA styled textures)
Faithful Community - Faithful 32x (Creating textures for latest/snapshot versions)
AntVenom - FaithfulVenom (Inspiration)

Honestly, I cannot reasonably list the amount of noteworthy mentions and other credits. 
The community in the Faithful Team Discord are responsible for many of the snapshot textures that not 
only make it into Faithful 32x, but my pack before they are officially added to Faithful 32x.

A majority of this pack would not exist if not for Vattic, xMrVizzy (and the Faithful Team), and the other 
members of the Faithful Discord.
