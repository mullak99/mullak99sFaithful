**Branch: 1.12**

The recommended branch will contain the recommended version of the resourcepack, this will oftenly be for the latest full-release version of Minecraft.

The 1.12 branch will contain the most up-to-date version of the resourcepack for Minecraft 1.12.x. Changes will rarely be made to this branch, unless some major issue is found.

**Current Version: v1.12**
